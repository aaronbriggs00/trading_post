                  Trading Post is a resource for companies and individuals who
                  sell goods at local farmers' markets. Markets are seeded via a
                  USDA api.
                </h6>
                <h6>
                  The advantage of a farmers' market is direct access to
                  consumers who are willing to pay higher prices for goods and
                  services associated via market with freshness, quality, and
                  originality. Unfortunately the temporal nature of a farmer's
                  market s it difficult for vendors to move large quantities of
                  product. The low prices typically offered by bulk grocery
                  purchasers is to account for this difficulty.
                </h6>
                <h6>
                  Vendors are limited in attendance to markets typically by
                  (days of the week) * (employees and transportation). This
                  service would allow entrepeneurial vendors to discover and
                  potentially trade for or purchase others' products sold at
                  events they plan on attending to facilitate oppurtunities to
                  further business growth.

                  We made it to deployment! I'm always willing to try new ideas
                  and implement new features. It always feels unsettling to make
                  changes to a project that's in a working state, but my
                  ultimate purpose of this development is for challenge and
                  learning so if you have any suggestions, reach out to me and
                  let's do it!
